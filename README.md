The skin disease detection Using Machine Learning project is a web-based tool that uses deep learning to detect and classify 13 common skin diseases from uploaded images.
It integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model into a user-friendly Flask web application styled with Tailwind CSS. Users can register, log in, upload images,
and receive disease predictions with confidence scores, medicine suggestions, and doctor advice. The system enhances early detection
and provides medical guidance, especially in areas lacking dermatological services. This project demonstrates how AI can support accessible
and efficient healthcare through intelligent, image-based skin disease diagnosis.

This system uses a deep learning model trained on labeled skin disease images to accurately classify 13 types of skin diseases. Once the prediction is made, the system also provides medicine suggestions and doctor consultation advice to guide the user.

This project is build using flask framework and html,css,js is used to make it a profical and neat wed page.
